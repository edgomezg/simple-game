# 2D Game Project

This simple 2D game project showcases my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. In this game, the player controls a character who must collect as many totems as possible to increase their scoreâ€”all while dodging fireballs that appear randomly on the map. The character has the ability to shoot magic projectiles to destroy these fireballs, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. Moreover, the game environment includes various obstacles with real-world scaling, which the character can collide with, creating a more immersive experience.
